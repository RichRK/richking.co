					<p>My name's Rich King&mdash;yes, really&mdash;and I was born in a small town in England before I later transplanted myself to Vancouver almost entirely by accident. My friend got himself a Canadian work visa, convinced me to get one too, and then disappeared back to the UK six months later. Betrayal, Henry. I'll never forget!</p>



					<p>I had the idea for Remember When* just as a couple of my friends were getting married &mdash; I desperately wanted to get them a unique gift, one worthy of all the years of strong friendship and camaraderie we'd shared. All the tough times we'd made it through, etc, etc. Which is when I realised I had about $6 to spare. I think there was a small cup on their gift list I could've gone with.</p>



					<p>So I popped my thinking cap on, took my camera to their wedding and tried to put together something they could laugh over in a few years time. What I actually ended up creating was a video of all their closest friends exposing various drunken antics from over the years, plus a couple of bonus examples from that very night. It was excellent.</p>



					<p>Anyway, fast forward a bit and Remember When is the result of lots of work, frustration and a touch of craziness. And I couldn't be prouder. I hope you get as much enjoyment out of it as I do in having made it real.</p>
