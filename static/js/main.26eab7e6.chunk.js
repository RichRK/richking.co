My intent was to demonstrate the improvements we could make to our members\u2019 experience when they\'re ready to enter a new property into our central database. (At which point the property typically becomes available to the general public.)","Agents currently have two choices: fill out a six-page PDF document\u2014which must be emailed over to us\u2014or enter the property details online through MLS software we license. The latter might seem to be the more appealing of the two, but it comes with its own shortcomings.","First and foremost, the MLS software doesn\'t have a responsive interface. When visiting the site from a mobile device the regular desktop layout is always presented. Secondly, even to look at it in isolation as a purely desktop-based experience, it hasn\'t been well thought out \u2014 the interface is clumsy and difficult to navigate. The clearest way to describe it would be to say it feels generic, likely the result of it originally being created for financial software more than a decade ago. Both of these shortcomings have a significant negative impact on the member experience.","So, how to address this? I envisaged an entirely schema-driven form: the structure, data and validation all living within a single JSON file, to be assembled into an approachable and intuitive interface by a modern JavaScript framework. The advantages would be threefold: members would receive a modern, mobile-first solution with which to enter their listings, one consistent with our branding; we would gain an additional way to differentiate ourselves from other boards in the area, an especially important trait when considering potential members living just outside of our jurisdiction; and we would maintain consistency of member experience if we switched to an alternative MLS software provider in the future."],"process":["Ensuring the viability of my idea before getting in too deep was paramount, so I initially limited myself to only building a subset of the first page of the PDF. Only once I was satisfied with how it had come together did I proceed to assemble the rest.","Vue 3 was my framework of choice, mostly because I enjoy working with it. Nonetheless, this project could\u2019ve been realised with React just as easily.","In an effort to reduce the time I\u2019d spend designing each individual input component, I decided to experiment with the PrimeFaces UI library. In this way I was able to quickly grab their base components and make alterations as necessary. One approach I used a couple of times was to group particular inputs into single components where it made sense to do so. For example: radio buttons and checkboxes were a natural fit, due to the significant degree of overlap between their behaviours and layout requirements."],"challenges":["One stands out in particular: the best way to capture the extensive information associated with each room, bathroom and open house entered for a property. Each of these objects are composed of several different fields and have their own limitations on how many are permitted. In the end I built a \u201crepetition\u201d component, one capable of instantiating new versions of its contents whenever the existing instances had been fully populated with data. I was pleased with this approach because it strongly promotes component reusability: anything could be dropped in going forward, with minimal modification.","I also ran into an apparent bug with one of the PrimeFaces components. I opened an issue on their repository but I also cobbled together a temporary workaround so I wouldn\u2019t have to wait on them. If they\u2019re unable to address the issue then I should probably revisit the workaround to verify it\u2019s the cleanest approach."],"future":["This whole project was very much a proof-of-concept, and the design reflects that. Maintaining the layout as a single page was as much for my own convenience as it was a design choice \u2014 going forward I believe there would be definite benefit to be had from splitting the form into separate sections. Not only to reduce the intimidation factor when a user first arrives, but also to simplify the process of getting back to a field when you can\'t remember where it\u2019s located.","Otherwise, there are countless other improvements that would naturally manifest if this were to become a fully fledged project: auto-saving for people who want to resume later, the ability to upload photos, hiding certain fields if they no longer apply (based on choices made earlier, for example). There are plenty of possibilities.","Having said that \u2014 the most sensible immediate next step would be to solicit feedback from existing power users, of both the PDF and desktop interface. Hearing their thoughts at this early stage would help inform our priorities going forward, strengthening our ability to design for the people we\u2019re most looking to help."]},"language":"Vue","repo":"https://github.com/RichWK/newlistingspa","title":"Listing form"},{"_key":2,"content":{"requirements":["Let\'s begin with some context! Within the world of real estate each property is assigned its own unique \u2018property identification number\u2019, or \u2018PID number\u2019 for short. Detached, single-family homes have one, duplexes have a couple and in the case of apartments, each unit has its own separate PID.","The challenge arises when agents wish to add their new property to the central MLS system but a PID number hasn\u2019t yet been assigned. It\u2019s not possible to create a listing without one, so, suddenly: here\u2019s a stumbling block.","For a long time the solution has been to hand out \u2018fake\u2019 PIDs to agents, ones they can use in place of the actual PID until the real one has been issued. These fake PIDs occupy a certain range so they can easily be identified at a later date.","For at least a decade we\u2019ve had a basic internal web app allowing staff to generate these fake PIDs. However, in the course of this app being migrated to a new server, it partially broke \u2014 suddenly going from issuing up to nine PIDs at a time to only one. Compounding this issue was the original source code having been misplaced and lost many years prior. The only path forward was to build a new solution from scratch.","As such, the primary requirements can really be summed up in two parts: the obvious need to re-create the PID generator as a modern service, but also to design it in a way that our members would be able to use it themselves. This last part was key \u2014 it would remove the necessity of them calling staff each and every time they found themselves in need, thus reducing the amount of time spent dealing with this on a day-to-day basis."],"process":["This project overlapped entirely with the much larger work of us changing CRM system, moving from a slightly dated on-premises solution to a modern one located in Azure (Microsoft Dynamics). Despite this progressive move, the majority of the new integration points were still set to run through the on-premises data centre. This struck me as vaguely anachronistic and became part of my motivation to ensure this PID generator project would be entirely cloud-native \u2014 the organisation\u2019s first in its entirety.","My chosen infrastructure became:",["Azure Blob Storage for the frontend. Microsoft also offer the \u2018Azure Static Web Apps\u2019 service (capable of auto-publishing any new commits made to a git repository, \xe0 la Netlify) but this offering was still in preview status at the time and they were discouraging its use in production environments.","Azure Functions for the backend \u2014 the prime job being to communicate with the database and perform validation. Azure Functions supports a variety of languages but I chose C# for a couple of reasons: it\u2019s generally favoured by the organisation, but it also has the fastest cold boot times out of all the supported languages. (I had come across someone\u2019s comprehensive write-up extensively comparing cold boot times for each Azure Functions language.)","Azure Cosmos DB for the database. Someone pointed out to me that a distributed database was a strange choice for what would be essentially the sole task of incrementing consecutive IDs, but the main motivation here was Microsoft having recently enabled serverless billing. (An alternative to their traditional model, which has always required a base level of throughput to be reserved and paid for.) This meant a free tier for the Cosmos DB service, a vast reduction in cost compared with the other billing model. The PID generator has always been a relatively low priority service, so being able to guarantee zero costs was a great bonus."],"Last but not least, Vue was my choice of framework for the frontend, despite the small scale of the app. This decision was partly based on wanting to simplify the handling of incoming PIDs as much as possible, but also because it seemed like a good opportunity to familiarise myself more with Vue."],"challenges":["Composing the backend logic definitely took longer than I\u2019d anticipated, mostly because I hadn\u2019t expected the Azure Function to need to perform an atomic read-write on the database. It\u2019s imperative that members don\'t receive the same PID as someone else, so the database must finish reading, incrementing and writing the new value prior to allowing anyone else to read it.","This simply isn\u2019t possible with the .NET SDK \u2014 because Cosmos DB isn\u2019t designed to work this way. Nevertheless, the promise of zero costs meant I wasn\u2019t deterred for very long, and I ended up writing a stored procedure within the database\u2019s JavaScript environment. This also provided an unexpected benefit: the read-write was now computationally cheaper than it would\u2019ve been otherwise. For a web app with such low traffic this won\u2019t result in any real-world differences, but I view it as valuable knowledge for future projects; at a larger scale it could result in significant cost savings."],"future":["Some functionality discussed initially but ultimately rejected was to keep a record of which agent had been issued with which PID. While this would have been informative, in the end there wasn\'t really a strong enough reason for the data to be retained. If greater accountability of the PIDs were deemed to be a priority in the future though, this would be a good place to start."]},"language":"C#","repo":"https://github.com/RichWK/GeneratePids","title":"PID generator"},{"_key":3,"content":{},"language":"Python","repo":"","title":"Automated
